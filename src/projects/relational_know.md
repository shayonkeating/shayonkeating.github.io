Using Natural Language Processing from OpenAI's whisper model, a knowledge graph
was built from connections. This web of knowledge bridges together ideas that
make most sense to bridge together. This could be pushed out further into the
diagnostic space, imagine a doctor charting, and what they say can be used to
make the most likely diagnosis through a "fabric" of knowledge.
